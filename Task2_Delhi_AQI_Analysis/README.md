This folder contains an exploratory analysis of Delhi’s air quality using an hourly AQI dataset with key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, and NH₃. The goal is to understand pollution levels, identify the most polluted dates and peak hours, and study relationships between pollutants to inform health-focused insights. Methods include data cleaning, creating a simple AQI proxy from particulate matter, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and time series visualizations (daily and diurnal patterns).
